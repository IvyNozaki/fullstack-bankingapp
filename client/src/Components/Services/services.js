            <p className="modal-p">PiggyBank cards works like a standard debit card but with all the perks. Don’t be limited by area, use anywhere with our interchangeable payment processors. Choose Visa or MasterCard* when requesting for a bankcard.  We do not limit our members to one card so go ahead and order both.
            All PiggyBank cards are tied to the very first account you open but we won’t stop you there. Check out mobile banking to change which account your card is currently tied to. We offer realtime change status so you are never confused about when the changes have applied.
            *All cards come as MasterCard unless requested otherwise. Cards can only be tied to one account at a time. Adding another card to your account will generate a new card number which differs from duplicate cards.</p>
